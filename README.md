This repository contains the code and documentation for Task 1 of my Software Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
# A SUMMARY ABOUT THE TASK
I developed a temperature converter application using Python and the Tkinter library. This application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. I created functions for each conversion, such as `celsius_to_fahrenheit` and `fahrenheit_to_kelvin`. The main function, `convert_temperature`, handles user input, validates it, and performs the conversions based on the selected unit. The interface includes entry fields, radio buttons for unit selection, and a convert button, all arranged using Tkinterâ€™s grid layout. When the user clicks the convert button, the results are displayed in a message box. Through this project, I learned how to create a GUI with Tkinter, handle user inputs, and implement temperature conversion formulas effectively.
